title: "Exandria Reborn"
---

Wildemount has changed. It's been thirty years since Chione's Folly. The Empire has all but collapsed. The Clovis Republic is a new player on the international stage. The thumb of imperial rule has made way for loosely affiliated city states, and a reliance on adventurers and heroes has reawakened in these exciting new times. And something stirs, deep beneath the surface... Something old...

Welcome to Wildemount.
