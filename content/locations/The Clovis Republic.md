title: "The Clovis Republic"
---

The Clovis Concord, the merchant republic along the Menagerie Coast, has shifted from a Merchant Republic to a full republican nation. It is now arguably one of the strongest nations on the continent, second only to the Kryn Dynasty. Known for all the usual oceangoing exploration and trade as before, they’re now also of interest to the international arcane community because of the Kierkegaard Institute for Exoplanar Studies in Nicodranas. This facility accommodates exploration of other planes, though highly regulated and bureaucratic. It is also the home base of two airships that have a capacity to reach near-Exandria orbit, opening an entirely new field of research. The seat of Grand Marquis of the Clovis Republic, voted in as chairperson by and from all the local cities’ Marquises, is currently held by Folred Jothana, the Marquis from Gwardan.

## Palma Flora
A small beach town on the southern edge of the Vezdali Penninsula, Palma Flora is primarily a beach resort, with the local town economy made up of either tourism or shark hunters. Small and quiet, the local milita is a loose group of shark hunters, and most people find their way here for a relaxing beach holiday.
