title: "The Dwendalian Empire"
---

The area to the immediate south-west of Rexxentrum has been entirely destroyed. The crater that resulted from the impact of one of Chione’s icicles filled with its molten water and became a lake named Sterbeloch that quickly formed a natural egress to Erdeloch. The Cobalt Soul and other public or international services never returned (or rather; were never welcomed back) to the city. 

In the past 30 years since Chione’s Folly caused the destruction of almost a third of the city of Rexxentrum, the Dwendalian Empire has all but fallen apart. When rumors began circulating that the world was saved by a dishonorably discharged and disgraced former officer of the Empire, and that he did so allied with a gnome trained in Kryn magics, a tiefling who served Avandra, a frail old lady, and some guy who made deals, people and indeed entire cities began questioning the Empire’s public face. 

As more and more of the Empire’s self-centered interests came to light, and its primary interest in protecting only those in power, a quick cascade of breakaways and independence declarations followed. In only a few years the Empire was reduced to the following lands and borders

The area was flanked north and south by natural mountains and the west by rivers. The eastern borders saw a quick erection of a large wall that spanned from the Dunrock Mountains to the Silberquel Ridge. Most forces, where they did not defect, were retreated to these new areas. Fifteen years ago, rumors began circulating that the King and his family had died- and indeed, around that time there’ve been no public appearances or even sightings of the Dwendal family.

Travel to and from what remained of the Empire became more and more difficult. All borders were heavily policed and patrolled by the military and all but closed to common travellers. It quickly became clear that the Cerberus Assembly, already rumored to be the true power in the Empire, had taken over entirely.
