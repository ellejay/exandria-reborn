{"/":{"title":"Exandria Reborn","content":"\nWildemount has changed. It's been thirty years since Chione's Folly. The Empire has all but collapsed. The Clovis Republic is a new player on the international stage. The thumb of imperial rule has made way for loosely affiliated city states, and a reliance on adventurers and heroes has reawakened in these exciting new times. And something stirs, deep beneath the surface... Something old...\n\nWelcome to Wildemount.\n\n\u003cTheme song!\u003e\n\n[Session Notes](misc/Session%20Notes.md)\n\n[Inventory](misc/Inventory.md)\n\n[Characters](misc/Characters.md)\n\n[Locations](misc/Locations.md)","lastmodified":"2022-07-12T22:51:50.864272176Z","tags":null},"/characters/Player-Characters":{"title":"Player Characters","content":"\n# Player Characters\n\n## Marek Mountebank\nThe red skinned pirate tiefling\n![marek](characters/images/marek.jpg)\n\n## Zaira\nThe yuan-ti with a bounty on her head\n![zaira](characters/images/zaira.jpg)","lastmodified":"2022-07-12T22:51:50.864272176Z","tags":null},"/locations/The-Clovis-Republic":{"title":"The Clovis Republic","content":"\nThe Clovis Concord, the merchant republic along the Menagerie Coast, has shifted from a Merchant Republic to a full republican nation. It is now arguably one of the strongest nations on the continent, second only to the Kryn Dynasty. Known for all the usual oceangoing exploration and trade as before, they’re now also of interest to the international arcane community because of the Kierkegaard Institute for Exoplanar Studies in Nicodranas. This facility accommodates exploration of other planes, though highly regulated and bureaucratic. It is also the home base of two airships that have a capacity to reach near-Exandria orbit, opening an entirely new field of research. The seat of Grand Marquis of the Clovis Republic, voted in as chairperson by and from all the local cities’ marquises, is currently held by Folred Jothana, the marquis from Gwardan.\n\n![ClovisRepublic](locations/images/ClovisRepublic.PNG)","lastmodified":"2022-07-12T22:51:50.868272191Z","tags":null},"/misc/Characters":{"title":"Characters","content":"\n[Player Characters](characters/Player%20Characters.md)\n","lastmodified":"2022-07-12T22:51:50.872272206Z","tags":null},"/misc/Inventory":{"title":"Inventory","content":"\n## Party Funds\nWe're broke, let's not kid ourselves","lastmodified":"2022-07-12T22:51:50.872272206Z","tags":null},"/misc/Locations":{"title":"Locations","content":"\n[The Clovis Republic](locations/The%20Clovis%20Republic.md)","lastmodified":"2022-07-12T22:51:50.872272206Z","tags":null},"/misc/Session-Notes":{"title":"Session Notes","content":"\n[Ship to Wreck](notes/Ship%20to%20Wreck.md)\n","lastmodified":"2022-07-12T22:51:50.872272206Z","tags":null},"/notes/Ship-to-Wreck":{"title":"Ship to Wreck","content":"\nTo the sea!","lastmodified":"2022-07-12T22:51:50.872272206Z","tags":null}}
