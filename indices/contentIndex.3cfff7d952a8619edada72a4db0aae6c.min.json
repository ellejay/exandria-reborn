{"/":{"title":"Exandria Reborn","content":"\nWildemount has changed. It's been thirty years since Chione's Folly. The Empire has all but collapsed. The Clovis Republic is a new player on the international stage. The thumb of imperial rule has made way for loosely affiliated city states, and a reliance on adventurers and heroes has reawakened in these exciting new times. And something stirs, deep beneath the surface... Something old...\n\nWelcome to Wildemount.\n\n\u003cTheme song!\u003e\n\n[Session Notes](misc/Session%20Notes.md)\n\n[Inventory](misc/Inventory.md)\n\n[Characters](misc/Characters.md)\n\n[Locations](misc/Locations.md)","lastmodified":"2022-08-05T21:38:25.793885874Z","tags":null},"/characters/Player-Characters":{"title":"Player Characters","content":"\n## Jianu\n![jianu](characters/images/jianu.png)\n\n## Mirko Móré\n![mirko](characters/images/mirko.png)\n\n## Marek Mountebank\n![marek](characters/images/marek.jpg)\n\n## Oryctolo \"Ory\" Bracchi\n![ory](characters/images/ory.png)\n\n## Zaira\n![zaira](characters/images/zaira.png)","lastmodified":"2022-08-05T21:38:25.793885874Z","tags":null},"/locations/The-Clovis-Republic":{"title":"The Clovis Republic","content":"\nThe Clovis Concord, the merchant republic along the Menagerie Coast, has shifted from a Merchant Republic to a full republican nation. It is now arguably one of the strongest nations on the continent, second only to the Kryn Dynasty. Known for all the usual oceangoing exploration and trade as before, they’re now also of interest to the international arcane community because of the Kierkegaard Institute for Exoplanar Studies in Nicodranas. This facility accommodates exploration of other planes, though highly regulated and bureaucratic. It is also the home base of two airships that have a capacity to reach near-Exandria orbit, opening an entirely new field of research. The seat of Grand Marquis of the Clovis Republic, voted in as chairperson by and from all the local cities’ Marquises, is currently held by Folred Jothana, the Marquis from Gwardan.\n\n![ClovisRepublic](locations/images/ClovisRepublic.PNG)\n\n## Palma Flora\nA small beach town on the southern edge of the Vezdali Penninsula, Palma Flora is primarily a beach resort, with the local town economy made up of either tourism or shark hunters. Small and quiet, the local milita is a loose group of shark hunters, and most people find their way here for a relaxing beach holiday.","lastmodified":"2022-08-05T21:38:25.793885874Z","tags":null},"/locations/The-Dwendalian-Empire":{"title":"The Dwendalian Empire","content":"\nThe area to the immediate south-west of Rexxentrum has been entirely destroyed. The crater that resulted from the impact of one of Chione’s icicles filled with its molten water and became a lake named Sterbeloch that quickly formed a natural egress to Erdeloch. The Cobalt Soul and other public or international services never returned (or rather; were never welcomed back) to the city. \n\nIn the past 30 years since Chione’s Folly caused the destruction of almost a third of the city of Rexxentrum, the Dwendalian Empire has all but fallen apart. When rumors began circulating that the world was saved by a dishonorably discharged and disgraced former officer of the Empire, and that he did so allied with a gnome trained in Kryn magics, a tiefling who served Avandra, a frail old lady, and some guy who made deals, people and indeed entire cities began questioning the Empire’s public face. \n\nAs more and more of the Empire’s self-centered interests came to light, and its primary interest in protecting only those in power, a quick cascade of breakaways and independence declarations followed. In only a few years the Empire was reduced to the following lands and borders\n\n![DwendalianEmpire](locations/images/DwendalianEmpire.png)\n\nThe area was flanked north and south by natural mountains and the west by rivers. The eastern borders saw a quick erection of a large wall that spanned from the Dunrock Mountains to the Silberquel Ridge. Most forces, where they did not defect, were retreated to these new areas. Fifteen years ago, rumors began circulating that the King and his family had died- and indeed, around that time there’ve been no public appearances or even sightings of the Dwendal family.\n\nTravel to and from what remained of the Empire became more and more difficult. All borders were heavily policed and patrolled by the military and all but closed to common travellers. It quickly became clear that the Cerberus Assembly, already rumored to be the true power in the Empire, had taken over entirely.","lastmodified":"2022-08-05T21:38:25.793885874Z","tags":null},"/misc/Characters":{"title":"Characters","content":"\n[Player Characters](characters/Player%20Characters.md)\n","lastmodified":"2022-08-05T21:38:25.80588595Z","tags":null},"/misc/Inventory":{"title":"Inventory","content":"\n## Party Funds\n**17** gp\n\n**169** sp\n\n**50** cp\n\n## Items Found\n30gp of jewellery\n\n+1 Dagger (Mirko)\n\nBag of Caltrops\n\nA Trident\n\nA Spear \n\n2 Longswords, 2 Shortswords, 2 Daggers, Breastplate (Ory), 2 Barrels of Water (Fresh/Salt), 2 Shields (1 Marek), 3 Spears","lastmodified":"2022-08-05T21:38:25.80588595Z","tags":null},"/misc/Locations":{"title":"Locations","content":"\n[The Dwendalian Empire](locations/The%20Dwendalian%20Empire.md)\n\n[The Clovis Republic](locations/The%20Clovis%20Republic.md)","lastmodified":"2022-08-05T21:38:25.80588595Z","tags":null},"/misc/Session-Notes":{"title":"Session Notes","content":"\nPrologue #1 [Captive Market](notes/Captive%20Market.md)\nPrologue #2 [Ship to Wreck](notes/Ship%20to%20Wreck.md)\n\n#1 [Shark Week](notes/Shark%20Week.md)\n#2 [Hearthstar Peaks](notes/Hearthstar%20Peaks.md)","lastmodified":"2022-08-05T21:38:25.80588595Z","tags":null},"/notes/Captive-Market":{"title":"Captive Market","content":"","lastmodified":"2022-08-05T21:38:25.80588595Z","tags":null},"/notes/Hearthstar-Peaks":{"title":"Hearthstar Peaks","content":"","lastmodified":"2022-08-05T21:38:25.80588595Z","tags":null},"/notes/Shark-Week":{"title":"Shark Week","content":"","lastmodified":"2022-08-05T21:38:25.80588595Z","tags":null},"/notes/Ship-to-Wreck":{"title":"Ship to Wreck","content":"\nTo the sea!","lastmodified":"2022-08-05T21:38:25.80588595Z","tags":null}}
